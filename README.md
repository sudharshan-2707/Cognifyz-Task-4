ðŸš€ Task 4: Complex Form Validation & Dynamic DOM Manipulation

Iâ€™m excited to share my progress on Cognifyz Task-4! This challenge pushed me to enhance user experience and functionality through advanced techniques in front-end development. Here's what I accomplished:

âœ… Enhanced Form Validation: Implemented advanced validation rules, such as password strength checks and custom error messages, ensuring a seamless and secure user experience.

âœ… Dynamic DOM Updates: Leveraged JavaScript (ES6+) to create dynamic UI components that respond in real-time to user interactions. Think auto-updating elements and live feedback!

âœ… Client-Side Routing: Integrated React Router for a smoother, single-page application experienceâ€”no more unnecessary page reloads!

Technologies used:
ðŸ”¹ React.js
ðŸ”¹ React Router
ðŸ”¹ JavaScript (ES6+)
ðŸ”¹ CSS, HTML, Bootstrap
